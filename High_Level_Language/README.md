# High Level Language

* A high-level language has been designed to write programs that can run on our computer system.

* The [Language Manual](https://github.com/PandaKing9660/RISC_Vs_US/blob/main/High_Level_Language/Language%20Manual.pdf) defines the high-level language and all the features and constructs available in it.

* For the purpose of testing the computer system, a set of programs were designed that exhaustively test all the aspects of the programming language. 


## Test Programs

### Simple 

1. File: [pgm_simple1.code](https://github.com/PandaKing9660/RISC_Vs_US/blob/main/High_Level_Language/pgm_simple1.code). 

    Performs various operations based on the user input. 
    
    Tests basic features like:
    * Arithmetic and bitwise operations.
    * Functionality of Switch-Case.
    * Takes input from the user.
    * Writes to standard output.


2. File: [pgm_simple2.code](https://github.com/PandaKing9660/RISC_Vs_US/blob/main/High_Level_Language/pgm_simple2.code). 

    Displays the ascii values of the last 5 letters in the alphabet.

    Verifies the functionality of:
    * Arrays and its usage.
    * String declaration.
    * Type coercion.

3. File: [pgm_simple3.code](https://github.com/PandaKing9660/RISC_Vs_US/blob/main/High_Level_Language/pgm_simple3.code). 

    Checks if a number is a prime number or not and prints the appropriate message.

    Tests: 
    * Comparison operators
    * Modulo operation
    * **continue**, **return**, etc. functionalities.

4. File: [pgm_simple4.code](https://github.com/PandaKing9660/RISC_Vs_US/blob/main/High_Level_Language/pgm_simple4.code). 

    Rounds off the decimal number upto a certain precision.

    Tests: 
    * Type coercion
    * Floating point numbers.

### Moderate 

1. File: [pgm_moderate1.code](https://github.com/PandaKing9660/RISC_Vs_US/blob/main/High_Level_Language/pgm_moderate1.code). 
    
    This is a Matrix multiplication (3x3) algorithm that uses 1d arrays to implement matrix. It implemets the matrices in **row-major** form. This program can reveal any potential memory allocation issues.

2. File: [pgm_moderate2.code](https://github.com/PandaKing9660/RISC_Vs_US/blob/main/High_Level_Language/pgm_moderate2.code).  

    This program implements a **Queue** which is an abstract data structure. It uses an array implicitly. Supports push and pop operations.

### Complex 

1. File: [pgm_complex1.code](https://github.com/PandaKing9660/RISC_Vs_US/blob/main/High_Level_Language/pgm_complex1.code).  

    Implements **Selection sort** algorithm. It takes input from the user, sorts the array and displays it.

2. File: [pgm_complex2.code](https://github.com/PandaKing9660/RISC_Vs_US/blob/main/High_Level_Language/pgm_complex2.code).

    Calculates the number of possible combinations **(nCr)**.Recursively computes the result for subproblems.

    Tests: 
    * Function declaration
    * Function calls
    * Call stack
    * Recursion
    * Returning statements, etc.

3. File: [pgm_complex3.code](https://github.com/PandaKing9660/RISC_Vs_US/blob/main/High_Level_Language/pgm_complex3.code).

    This program implements a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**. It internally uses an array. The BST supports insert operation. It maintains the BST property, i.e., the nodes in the left subtree of a node have keys less than that of the node and the nodes in the right subtree of the node have keys higher that the of the node.
