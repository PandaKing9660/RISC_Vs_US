## Introduction
1. In this project you can find a compiler for the programming language developed by ```RISC_Vs_US``` team.
2. You may refer to the language manual here (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IAW91fNMeh6gcIINUFF5NAg-Zl-5EekPPTUq8fAZZ5Q/edit?usp=sharing).
3. One can also refer to the examples given in the test case folder(for more clarity refer to ```Folder Structure```).


## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository from (https://github.com/PandaKing9660/RISC_Vs_US.git).
2. To run the code, go to linux terminal under /{USER_PATH}/RISC_Vs_US/Compiler and type ```make```.
3. Then enter filename. As of now all test cases are in test-cases folder. So one such filepath (or) filename can be ```test-cases/final1```. Also you can give multiple files at the same time ```test-cases/final1 test-cases/final2``` by just separating file names with spaces.
4. The generated three address code will be stored in ```tac.txt``` file.
5. Output to given to the Virtual machine team(vm-code) will be stores in ```vm.vm``` file.

 ## Known issues and limitations
1. Pointers and structures are not introduced to the programming language yet.
2. Line numbers in error messages in case of giving multiple files is not dealt with.
